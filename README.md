# Automated LLM Code Deployment System

## Description

This project is an automated system developed for the "Tools in Data Science" (TDM) course at IITM BS. It is designed to receive a task brief via an API, use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the required code, and automatically deploy the resulting application to GitHub Pages.

## Setup & Usage

*(We will fill this section in later with instructions on how to set up the environment and run the server.)*

## Architecture
